# WriteUp

**WriteUp** is an open-source, self-hosted web app for turning audio or video into clear written documents.

It helps generate meeting minutes, captions, and letters while keeping everything private and under your control.

## What it’s for

WriteUp is built for students, teams, and small organizations that need proper documentation without relying on cloud-heavy or data-hungry tools.

No accounts.  
No permanent storage.  
No vendor lock-in.

## How it works

You upload an audio or video file from a meeting, talk, or any spoken content.

WriteUp processes the file temporarily, transcribes the speech, and formats the output using templates.

You review, edit, and export the result.

Once processing is complete, uploaded files are removed automatically.

## What you can generate

Meeting minutes that are structured and readable.  
Captions suited for different platforms and tones.  
Letters based on predefined or custom templates.

All outputs are editable before export.

---

## Privacy & control

WriteUp runs locally or on your own machine or server.

Files are processed only for as long as needed and are never stored permanently.

Your data stays with you.

## Design philosophy

Local-first by default.  
Simple workflows.  
Open-source and transparent.  
Built to be useful, not flashy.
